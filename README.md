**Introduction:**

This Jupyter Notebook project contains a model to predict the prices of houses in King County, USA based on certain factors, such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, and location. The model was trained on a dataset of over 20,000 house sales in King County.

**Data Extraction:**

The first step in building the model was to get the data. This involved downloading the dataset as a CSV file provided by IBM.

**Data Preparation:**

The second step in building the model was to prepare the data. This involved cleaning the data and removing any outliers. The data was then split into two sets: a training set and a test set. The training set was used to train the model, and the test set was used to evaluate the model's performance.

**Model Training:**

The model was trained using a machine learning algorithm called ridge regression. Ridge regression is a algorithmn that is used to avoid overfitting the model. Overfitting occurs when a model is trained on a specific dataset so well that it cannot generalize new data.

**Model Evaluation:**

Once the model was trained, it was evaluated on the test set. The model achieved an accuracy of over 74% on the test set, which means that it was able to predict the prices of houses within 26% of their actual prices.

**Conclusion:**

This Jupyter Notebook project contains a model that can be used to predict the prices of houses in King County, USA with high accuracy. The model can be used by homeowners, real estate agents, and investors to make informed decisions about buying and selling houses.
